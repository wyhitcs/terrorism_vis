# Terrorism Map
After Paris attacks in November 2015, besides fear, terrorism leaves people lots of questions. When and how is the organization ISIS generated and why do they choose certain place? The goal of our project is to visualize the evolution of terrorism in a world map based on the data offered by Global Terrorism Database (GTD).


The visualization consists of three parts, terrorist events overview, terrorism evolution and detail for some group. Each part doesnâ€™t limit to information about one aspect, but contains several small sheets which are interactive. Users can choose interesting information freely to view details. Besides, between each two collections, a common feature is used to make them related and coherent.

Tableau project on public server, you can kick and see it at  https://public.tableau.com/views/TerrorismMap/EvolutionandGroup?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&:toolbar=no
